# Capstone Project - Language Flash Cards Game

## The purpose of this project was to incorporate everything learned from the previous lessons about exceptions, dictionaries, using pandas for file data as well as using tkinter to build the application.

What I learned from this project was being able to be flexible with the functions that I created for this project and be able to manipulate the data that was needed to complete this project. I felt a lot more comfortable
using exceptions in this project because I dealt with an error once I was trying to create the words_to_learn file when it didn't exist. This was because I was trying to remove the words that was already known, by clicking the
green checkmark button, but the file didn't exist.

It was implemented to make sure that if it wasn't, that the main file would be loaded up and used for the data and then once the interaction occurred, then the file that would be used mainly would be the words_to_learn csv file
while removing the values from the main file.

Overall, I enjoyed doing this project, I felt like I could have done better, but I am proud of the progress I am making in this course.
